// This option is about walking in two different ways:
// If it is set to true, then walking (continuously) will work by sending a walk command for every game tick.
// If it is not set (or not true) walking continuously can be done by sending the walk command and then a stop walk
// command when you wish to stop walking. So basically less precision but easier to do and less messages.
